            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Muſt let the Reader underſtand, that the Book which I anſwer, firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>James I.</hi> under the Name of <hi>A Gagg for the New Goſpel.</hi> When it was immediately ſo expoſed to the Scorn of all Men, by Mr. <hi>R. Mountague,</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and at laſt of
<hi>Norwich</hi>) that for many Years it ſculkt, and durſt not ſhow its head, till they imagined that Baffle was forgot; and then out it came again, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles II.</hi> as if it had never been ſeen before, with this New Title, <hi>The Touch-Stone of the Reformed Goſpel:</hi> And the better to diſguiſe the Cheat, they begin the Book with a New
<hi>Chapter</hi> (or <hi>Section</hi>) and have quite <pb facs="tcp:94272:3"/> left out that which was formerly the <hi>Laſt Chapter;</hi> tranſpoſing alſo the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome of the reſt; making Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they imagine, in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and adding ſeveral whole Chapters. For there were but
<hi>XLVII.</hi> Points, (one of which, as I ſaid, they now have whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted) which they charged upon us, and undertook to confute in the Firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: But now they are improved to <hi>Two and Fifty;</hi> and ſet out as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a long Preface, of the very ſame Stamp with the Book; full, that is, of broad-fac'd <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths.</p>
            <p>Of which it may be expected, I ſhould here give ſome account: But my Anſwer to the Book it ſelf is grown ſo much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than I deſigned, that it muſt be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For the great Reaſon which was urged by thoſe who had power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me to undertake a <hi>New Anſwer</hi> to it, was; becauſe Biſhop <hi>Mountagu</hi>'s was ſo large, that few could purchaſe it. And therefore they thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful there ſhould be a more Compendious Confutation of the Book, though now it <pb facs="tcp:94272:3"/> be inlarged: eſpecially ſince they found it in every Pariſh of this great City, and in the very Priſons, where the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh-Prieſts could meet with any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
            <p>For which Reaſon, the ſame Perſons have perſuaded me, that what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, at their deſire, in the latter end of the late Reign, ought now to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the Prieſts of that Church, they aſſure me, are ſtill very buſie; and make account this little Book, which I anſwer, will do their buſineſs. For they put it into the hands of all thoſe whom they hope to make their Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; and deſire them to read it, as an unanſwerable Piece.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader judge of that, when he hath ſeriouſly conſidered what I have ſaid, to diſcover both the <hi>weakneſs</hi> and the <hi>diſhoneſty</hi> of its Author: Who underſtood neither the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor <hi>Fathers</hi> he quotes; or hath ſo perverted them, that as it coſt me more time, ſo I have been forced to uſe more
<pb facs="tcp:94272:4"/> Words than I intended to employ, to repreſent his unskilful, or falſe dealing. But I hope I ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tire the Reader, nor enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him unprofitably; but increaſe his Knowledge, by a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a conſiderable part of the Bible, and of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Eſpecially if he will be pleaſed to turn to the <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture; which I have explained, but not quoted at length, for fear of ſwelling this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer into too great a Bulk.</p>

                  <hi>I. The Proteſtants, he ſaith, affirm,</hi> That there is not in the Church <hi>One,</hi> and that an <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Holy Scriptures, and conſerving <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in matters of Faith.</head>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>THIS Propoſition is drawn up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully. For neither
<hi>we</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this, nor <hi>they</hi> maintain the contrary
<hi>univerſally,</hi> and without limitation. No <hi>Papiſt</hi> dare ſay there is <hi>one,</hi> and that an <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94272:5"/> 
                     <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> for underſtanding <hi>all</hi> the Holy Scripture. For then, why have we not an infallible Comment upon the whole Bible? Why do their Doctors diſagree in the interpretation of a thouſand places? He ought therefore to have ſaid, that we hold, <hi>There is not in the Church one, and that an infallible Rule for underſtanding as much as is neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. And then he belies us: For we believe the Scripture it ſelf gives us infallible Directions for the underſtanding of its ſenſe, in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: which if all would follow, there would be Unity in matters of
<hi>neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi> But God will not force men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe Directions. They may err; and they may quarrel, when they have an
<hi>infallible Rule</hi> to prevent both.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures therefore, whereby he proves what he charges upon us, muſt needs be impertinent. But it is ſomething ſtrange, that in the very <hi>firſt</hi> of them he ſhould be ſo ſenſleſs, as to give himſelf the lye. For he pretends to refute our errors, as his words are, by the <hi>expreſs</hi> words of our own Bibles, and immediately puts in a word of his own, inſtead of that in our Bibles; which ſay quite another thing. For inſtead of, <hi>according to the proportion of faith,</hi> (which are the words of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94272:5"/> XII. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.) He ſays, <hi>according to the rule of faith.</hi> What is this, but that
<hi>chopping and changing,</hi> which he falſly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us withall, in the end of his Preface? And it is a change not only of the <hi>words</hi> of our Bible, (which he promiſed to quote <hi>expreſly</hi>) but of the
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as it is expounded by the ancient Doctors: particularly St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and his Followers;<note place="margin">XII. Rom. 6.</note> who by <hi>proportion</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame with
<hi>Meaſure</hi> in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing v. 3. And thus <hi>Menochius,</hi> one of their own Interpreters, and a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> [ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum proportionem &amp; menſuram Fidei], i. e. <hi>according to the meaſure of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Wiſdom which God hath beſtowed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what can you expect from a man who falſifies in this manner, at the very firſt daſh? In the next Scripture, indeed, he finds the word <hi>Rule,</hi> (III. <hi>Philip.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">III. Phil.
16.</note>) and preſently imagines it is a Rule for the Interpreting of Scripture infallibly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas it is manifeſt to all who are not blinded with Prejudice, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſuppoſes in the words before, v. 15. they were not all of a mind in ſome things, for there were thoſe among them that believed in Chriſt, who thought the obſervation of
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law to be neceſſary alſo to Salvation; which was a dangerous <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94272:6"/> error, to mix Legal and Evangelical things together, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> here expounds it; but might poſſibly be cured, if Chriſtian Communion were not broken on either ſide, by reaſon of this difference: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, both the <hi>perfect,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their Freedom from the obligation of that Law, and the
<hi>imperfect,</hi> who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied it ſtill lay upon them, <hi>walked by the ſame rule,</hi> &amp;c. that is, preſerved Chriſtian Communion one with another, in the bond of Peace. For he ſpeaks here, ſaith
<hi>Theodoret,</hi> of concord; and the <hi>Rule</hi> is, the Evangelical Preaching or Doctrine: by which if we walk't, it would help to procure agreement in matters of Faith. But they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſo far from this, that they have broken all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, by their Tyrannical impoſitions, and making other rules beſides the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">VI. Gal. 16.</note>The next place evidently ſpeaks of the ſelf-ſame thing; that there is no neceſſity of being Circumciſed and obſerving the Law; but if we be regenerated by the Chriſtian Faith, we are ſure of the Divine Favour. In ſhort, the
<hi>Rule</hi> here ſpoken of, is that of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> mentioned in the foregoing words, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94272:6"/>But the 4th Text,<note place="margin">2 Cor. X. 15.</note> more fully ſhews this man to be a meer Trifler with words, without their ſenſe. For in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 15. There is not a Syllable of the <hi>Rule,</hi> or line of <hi>Faith,</hi> as he dreams: but only of the bounds and limits of thoſe Countrys, in which the Apoſtle had preach'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as <hi>Menochius</hi> himſelf interprets it. This he might have learnt, if he had pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the very next words, where the Apoſtle ſaith, he did not <hi>boaſt in another man's line,</hi> or rule, <hi>of things made ready to his hand: i. e.</hi> thoſe Countreys and Provinces which had been cultivated by other Apoſtles; glorying (as <hi>Menochius</hi> well gloſſes) in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Labours, as if they had been his own. Now this is a pretty <hi>infallible Rule</hi> of interpreting Scriptures, by the Regions in which the Apoſtles preached. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent proof, that there is <hi>one Rule</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> had his
<hi>own Rule,</hi> and others had <hi>their Rule:</hi> that is, not one and the ſame; for he took care not to preach the Goſpel in <hi>another man's line; i. e.</hi> in thoſe places where others had done it already. Are theſe
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in their wits, when they write on this faſhion? Either they have no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they write; or hope their Writings will fall into the hands of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94272:7"/> who underſtand nothing; elſe they would be aſhamed of ſuch wretched ſtuff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor.

<hi>Theodoret,</hi> he ſhows that theſe <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94272:7"/> things did not
<hi>ſeem ſo to him only, but to all the Churches of God.</hi> Let the

<hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious:</hi> Tho' I muſt tell them, that there are a vaſt many differences between the Decrees of the Paſtors of late times, tho' never ſo many hundreds; and the Authority of thoſe few Paſtors (as this man calls them) which had the preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only of twenty or thirty years after Chriſt. For theſe <hi>few Paſtors</hi> were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves, infallible men; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtolical perſons, who were guided by their directions.</p>
                  <p>And now he comes to tell us, by what other Titles this
<hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is called in Scripture; inſtead of telling us by what names, the <hi>Infallble Rule for underſtanding Scripture</hi> is called: For the good man, when he had gone thus far, had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what he was about.</p>

<hi>Menochius</hi> interprets it out of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> whoſe words are theſe; They that had their Original from <hi>Simon,</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> as much as to ſay, men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Knowledge: <hi>For thoſe things in which the Holy Scriptures were ſilent, they ſaid God had revealed to them.</hi> This the Apoſtle calls <hi>a falſe Knowledge;</hi> From whence I think it clearly follows, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> thought true Chriſtian Knowledge to be contained only in the Holy Scriptures: Which is the Doctrine he ſaith, (let the Romaniſts mind this) which <hi>all that have the dignity of Prieſthood, ought carefully to keep, and propoſe to themſelves, as a certain Rule, and by this ſquare all that they ſay, all that they do.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Tertullian (de Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</hi> C. 25.) underſtands by <hi>the thing committed unto him,</hi> that Doctrine which the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> delivered in this Epiſtle. To which <hi>Theodoret</hi> adds, <hi>the grace of the Holy Ghoſt, which he received at his Ordination:</hi> 
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94272:9"/> That is, his Office committed unto him, and all the Gifts of the Spirit beſtowed on him, to qualifie him for this Office.</p>
                  <p>He bids us <hi>ſee more</hi> in ſeveral other places of Scripture, whoſe words he is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to recite; and therefore I ſhall paſs them by: Becauſe if there had been any thing to be ſeen in them to his purpoſe, he would have ſet them forth at large.</p>
                  <p>And there is as little to be ſeen in the <hi>Fathers</hi> whom he mentions, to confirm his pretended Catholick Doctrine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth no more than name <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> without alledging their words. But he adventures to ſet down ſome words out of
<hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> tho he doth not tell us where to find them. We need not go far indeed to ſeek for them, they being in the beginning of his Book: where, he that is able to read it, may find a full confutation of the Romiſh Pretences. For having ſaid, that the way to preſerve our Faith found, is <hi>firſt</hi> by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Divine Law; Secondly,</hi> by the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> He raiſes this Objection (which ſhows how much the firſt of theſe is above the other) <hi>Since the Rule of the Scripture is perfect, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient unto it ſelf, for all purpoſes,</hi> (mark this, which cuts the Throat of the <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94272:9"/> 
                     <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſe) <hi>what need is there to joyn unto this, the Authority of the Catholick Senſe?</hi> To which he anſwers, that the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great depth, are not underſtood by all in the ſame Senſe: But <hi>Novatian</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands them one way,
<hi>Photinus</hi> another; <hi>Sabellius, Donatus, Arrius,</hi> &amp;c. another. And therefore becauſe of the windings and turnings of Error, the Line of Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Apoſtolical Interpretation, ſhould be directed according to the Rule of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Catholick Senſe. Thus he ends his Book, as he begins it. <hi>We have not recourſe to Eccleſiaſtical Tradition, becauſe the Scripture is not ſufficient to it ſelf for all things; but becauſe of various Interpretations.</hi> But then he immediately ſubjoins, in the entrance of his Book, what that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Senſe is (<hi>Chap.</hi> III. viz. <hi>That which is believed every where, and always, and by all.</hi> Which is a Rule by which we in this Church guide our ſelves, and from which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath departed. For which I refer the Reader to King <hi>James</hi> I. his Admonition,
<hi>pag.</hi> 331. and the Letter written in his Name to Cardinal
<hi>Peron,</hi> where he expreſly owns this Rule, <hi>p.</hi> 22. <hi>Edit. Lond.</hi> 1612.</p>
                  <p>And yet even this Rule hath its limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given it by
<hi>Vincentius</hi> himſelf; which <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94272:10"/> this Writer ſhould have been ſo honeſt as to have confeſſed. For in concluſion (Cap. XXXIX.) he ſaith, that the ancient Conſent of Fathers is to be ſtudiouſly ſought and followed, <hi>not in all the little Queſtions of the Divine Law,</hi> or Scripture, (for alas! there is no Conſent) <hi>but only or chiefly in the Rule of Faith.</hi> That is, in thoſe Queſtions (as he explains it (Cap. XLI) on which the Foundations of the <hi>whole Catholick Faith rely.</hi> And further he obſerves, That all Hereſies cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be confuted this way, but only thoſe which are newly invented, as ſoon as they ariſe, before they have falſified the Rules of the Ancient Faith, and before they have endeavoured to corrupt the Books of the Ancients, by the ſpreading of their poiſon. For inveterate Hereſies, and ſuch as have ſpread themſelves, muſt not be impugned this way, but <hi>only by the Authority of Holy Scripture;</hi> or at leaſt-wiſe, by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Councils of Catholick Prieſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have been convinced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                  <p>I have been the longer in this, becauſe he is a <hi>moſt worthy Witneſs,</hi> as this man calls him; by whom we are willing to be tried. And ſo we are by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſome of whoſe words he alſo at laſt adventures <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94272:10"/> to alledge, out of two Chapters of his Book of <hi>Preſcriptions againſt Hereticks.</hi> But as he jumbles together words far diſtant one from another; ſo he durſt not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Chapter between the XV. and the XIX. which would have explained the reaſon why ſometimes they diſputed not with <hi>Hereticks</hi> out of the Scripture; becauſe that Hereſy of which he there treats, did not receive ſome Scripture; and if it did receive ſome,<note place="margin">Cap. XVII.</note> 
                     <hi>it did not receive them intire, but perverted them by additions and detractions, as ſerved its purpoſe,</hi> &amp;c. In ſhort,
<hi>they would not acknowledg theſe things,</hi> that is, the Scriptures,
<hi>by which they ſhould bave been convinced.</hi> To what purpoſe then had it been to talk to them of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? No, <hi>let them believe</hi> (ſaith he Cap. XXIII.) <hi>without the Scripture, that they may believe againſt the Scripture;</hi> juſt as the preſent <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now do. From whence it is, that he calls Hereticks <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugae Scripturarum,</hi> men that fly from the light of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">L. d. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur. Carn. <hi>C. XLVII.</hi>
                     </note> Inſomuch that he lays down this for a Rule in the ſame Book, (Cap. III.) <hi>Take from</hi> Hereticks <hi>thoſe things which they have learnt from the Heathen, that they may ſtate their queſtions out of the Scripture alone; and they cannot ſtand.</hi> Unto which Rule, if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will yield,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94272:11"/> their Cauſe is gone. Let all Doctrines be examined by the Scripture, and we deſire no more: Unto which it is manifeſt
<hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> appeals in other places ſo plainly, that there is no way to evade it; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in his Book of <hi>the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> Cap. VI. Let them prove the Angels took Fleſh from the Stars; <hi>if they cannot prove it, becauſe it is not written,</hi> then Chriſt's Fleſh was not from thence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the ſame Chapter, <hi>there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this, becauſe the Scripture doth not ſay it.</hi> And plaineſt of all in the next Chapter, <hi>I do not receive what thou inferreſt of thy own, without Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let theſe men bluſh, if they can, who thus ſhameleſly pervert all things to a wrong ſenſe; as they do theſe two words,
<hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Form of Faith;</hi> Which this man hath the Confidence to ſay, is <hi>the knowledge of Tradition.</hi> But how we ſhould know any Tradition to be true, which is not contained in the Scripture, is the Queſtion; Eſpecially ſince there have been ſo many falſe Traditions, as is confeſs'd by all ſides. Beſides, it is ſo far from being true, that the Two forenamed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lay down Tradition for the Rule of Faith, or put it before the Scripture, that <hi>Vincentius</hi> expreſly puts the Divine <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94272:11"/> Scripture in the firſt place as our Guide; and then the Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe, as a means, in ſome caſes, to find the ſenſe of Scriptures.<note place="margin">Cap. XIII.</note> And
<hi>Tertullian</hi> as expreſly in that very Book which he quotes, and in the Chapter preceding, makes the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed, the Rule of Faith:</hi> Which is all contained in the Scripture, and needs the help of no Tradition but that, to prove it.</p>
                  <p>But after all, I muſt ask, what's all this which he babbles in the concluſion of this Chapter, to that which he pretends to prove in the beginning? That <hi>there is one Infallible Rule for underſtanding the Holy Scripture?</hi> Which, if he would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſenſe, he ſhould have ſhown is <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But not a ſyllable of this: He only endeavours to loſe his Reader in a miſt of Words. He knew, if he underſtood any thing, there is no <hi>Traditive Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Scripture: For if there be, Why is there ſuch difference among their own Interpreters in the Expoſition of it? Nay, Why do they reject Ancient Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of Scripture, for which there is ſome Tradition? As
<hi>Maldonate,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Jeſuite doth upon XIX. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. Where he confeſſes,<note place="margin">XIX. Mat. 11.</note> that <hi>almoſt all expound thoſe words,</hi> as if the ſenſe of them was,

The reſt of the Scripture, notwithſtanding this, may be eaſy; and the hard places, he doth not ſay are wreſted by every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94272:15"/> but only by ſuch as are <hi>unlearned and unſtable.</hi> Let us but learn, and be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly fixed in the Principles of Religion, and practice accordingly; then we ſhall not be in that danger, but may read the <hi>Revelation</hi> it ſelf without hazarding our Salvation. Nothing will be in danger of Deſtruction by reading the Scriptures humbly and piouſly (as they themſelves teach us to do) but only Men's Vices, and the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> which it is eaſy to ſee, in that hard Book The
<hi>Revelation,</hi> is doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in due time unto Deſtruction. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding every particular Paſſage, one may eaſily ſee in general, with a little help, that <hi>Rome</hi> is there intended; and not
<hi>Pagan Rome,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> which is dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into an Idolatrous and Tyrannical State.</p>
                  <p>The following Text is like to this, which doth not ſay,<note place="margin">VIII. Acts 30.</note> That the <hi>Eunuch</hi> could underſtand nothing in the Scriptures (for then he would not have troubled himſelf to read them) but that he could not underſtand that place of the Prophet, which he was reading when <hi>Philip</hi> met with him. Which was obſcure to him only in part, not in the whole, before he was converted to Chriſtianity; but is not ſo to us, who enjoy the glorious Light <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94272:15"/> of the Goſpel. In which there are ſome things we cannot underſtand; neither with a Guide, nor without: But other things, as I ſaid, are ſo plain, that we cannot miſtake them, unleſs we do it wilfully. Againſt which there in no help, tho we had the <hi>moſt Infallible Guide</hi> that ever was.</p>
                  <p>The next place ſpeaks not one word of the difficulty of the Scriptures, but rather ſuppoſes them to be eaſy enough, even in thoſe matters of which Chriſt was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">XXIV. Luke
25.</note> (XXIV. <hi>Luke</hi> 25.) if the Apoſtles had not been then
<hi>fools, and ſlow of heart.</hi> Which Names they had not deſerved, if the Scriptures had been ſo hard, that it was not their fault they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them before he expounded them. The things they read there, were not in themſelves difficult, but the Diſciples did not at that time ſufficiently attend to what was written. For if they <hi>could not</hi> (as this Man affirms) have underſtood them, I do not ſee how they could be juſtly blamed by our Saviour; much leſs ſo ſeverely reprehended. Beſides, it is to be obſerved, both of this place and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that they ſpeak of the <hi>Prophetical Writings,</hi> in which there are greater Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities than in other Parts of Scriptures; <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94272:16"/> and yet even theſe, if they had not been <hi>Fools,</hi> might have been underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting our Saviour to the pains of expounding them.</p>
                  <p>One would be tempted to think the Man diſtracted, when he ſet down the next place,<note place="margin">V. Rev. 1.</note> V.
<hi>Revel.</hi> 1. to prove his Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For <hi>the ſealed Book,</hi> which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſaid <hi>no man could read,</hi> was not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the enſuing Prophecy; which our Saviour preſently after opened, and hath in ſome meaſure let us into its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I beſeech the Reader to mark what a dolt this Man is, who makes the Book of Scripture <hi>to be ſhut with ſo many Seals, that even in St.</hi> John<hi>'s, and the Apoſtles times, none could be found either in Heaven or Earth, able to open the ſame, or look therein.</hi> For what is the conſequence of this, if it be true, but that the Bible muſt be quite thrown away, and neither <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> nor <hi>Pope,</hi> nor <hi>Council</hi> look therein? For they cannot be more able than St. <hi>John,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles. O that all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would ſee by what ſottiſh Guides they are led on in darkneſs!</p>
                  <p>If he had thought that heap of Texts which follow, would have done him any Service, we ſhould have had their words no doubt, and not merely the Chapter <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94272:16"/> and Verſe; but they are ſet down only for ſhow, and the V. <hi>Revelat.</hi> is reckoned again, to make up the Tale. The <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> are mentioned for no other end, their words being ſo full and ſo numerous on our ſide, that it would fill a bigger Book than this, if I ſhould muſter them up. Particularly, thoſe very Fathers whom he quotes, and in the very Books he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are of our minds. But it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the ordinary Reader to obſerve, that at this Man's rate of proving, no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt read the Scriptures, no, not ſuch as St.
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> if the Scriptures be ſuch a Sea as he ſpeaks of, a depth of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Riddles. But the truth is, St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> doth not ſay what this Man makes him ſpeak; Not <hi>that it is a depth,</hi> &amp;c. but that <hi>it hath in it profound Senſes, and a depth of Prophetical Riddles.</hi> It hath ſo, and it hath alſo plain places in it, which are not ſo deep, but they may be fathomed by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, even by ſhallow Capacities. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſaith nothing contrary to this; but muſt be ſuppoſed to know enough, tho much leſs than what he did not know. And ſo muſt the reſt of the Fathers be underſtood, or elſe the Scripture is good for nothing, if even ſuch Men as <hi>Dionyſius, Gregory</hi> the Great, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could underſtand <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94272:17"/> little or nothing of it. If what they ſay be to his purpoſe, it is concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not others; and therefore they ought to have refrained from reading the Scripture, as well as the Vulgar. What then will become of the Common People, if their greateſt Guides could know ſo little of the Mind of God?</p>
                  <p>His laſt Author he took upon truſt, or elſe is an egregious Falſifier. For there is nothing to that purpoſe in the Chapter he quotes, <hi>L.</hi> VII. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. There are words to that effect in the 25th Chapter, where <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writing againſt thoſe who denied the <hi>Revelation of St.</hi> John to be a Divine Book, ſaith,
<q rend="margQuotes">Tho I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, yet I ſuppoſe there is a deeper ſenſe in the Words; and not meaſuring thoſe things, nor judging of them by my reaſonings, but giving more to Faith, <hi>I eſteem them to be higher than to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by me;</hi> but I do not reject that which I cannot underſtand, but admire it the more, becauſe I am not able to underſtand it.</q> Now, with what face could this Man apply that to the whole Scripture, which is ſpoken only of the Book of the <hi>Revelation?</hi> Let the Reader judg by this, what honeſtly he is to expect in other Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>

                  <hi>IV. He makes us ſay next,</hi> That Apoſtolical
<hi>Traditions,</hi> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtoms of the Church (not found in the
<hi>Written Word</hi>) are not to be received, nor do oblige us.</head>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>THIS is a downright Calumny; for we have ever owned, that
<hi>Apoſtolical Traditions,</hi> if we knew where to find them in any place but the Bible, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and followed, if delivered by them as of neceſſary Obligation. But we do likewiſe ſay, That we know no ſuch Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; for thoſe which have been called ſo, have been rejected even by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church it ſelf; or having received them, they have laid them aſide again. In ſhort, they ſometimes pretend to
<hi>Traditions,</hi> where there are none; and where there are, they have forſaken them; and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Caſes they pervert them, and turn them into another thing. As they have done, for inſtance, with
<hi>Purgatory-fire;</hi> which the Ancients thought would be at the Day of Judgment, and not till then; <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94272:18"/> but they have kindled already, and would have us believe Souls are now frying therein.</p>
                  <p>As for ancient <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo
<hi>Traditions,</hi> they have not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike, nor in all places one and the ſame. But the <hi>Church of</hi> England de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, That
<hi>whoſoever through his private judgment willingly and purpoſely doth openly break the Traditions</hi> (i. e Cuſtoms) <hi>and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God, and be ordained and approved by common Authority, ought to be rebuked openly,</hi> &amp;c. They are the very words of our XXXIVth. Article of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Which teaches withal, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular or National Church, hath Authority to change and aboliſh ſuch Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies or Rites as were ordained by man's Authority,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now what hath this Babbler to alledge out of our Bible againſt this? Truly, Nothing at all, but only the word <hi>Tradition,</hi> which he is very ignorant, if he do not know that we own. For we affirm, That the Doctrines of the Holy Scripture are Traditions: And of ſuch, the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> II. 15.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ II. 15.</note> which is thus expounded by <hi>Theodoret, Keep the Rule of Doctrine, the words delivered to you <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94272:18"/> by us; which we both Preached when we were preſent with you, and wrote when we were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> So that the things which were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were not different from thoſe which were written, but the very ſame. He ſpoke when he was with them, what he wrote when he was gone from them. Whence it is clear indeed, That the <hi>Traditions</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by word of mouth, were of equal Authority with what was written, (as this man gravely ſaith), for they were the ſame. And it is alſo certain, as he adds, That before the New Teſtament was written, all was delivered by word of mouth. But what then? Therefore A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Traditions are to be received. Yes; becauſe what was delivered by word of mouth, was the very ſame which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was written. But here is no ſhadow of proof, that we are bound to receive Traditions which were never written.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there more in the next place,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. III. 6.</note> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> III. 6. but much leſs; for there is not a ſyllable of word of mouth; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> expreſly ſays, That by <hi>Tradition</hi> here the Apoſtle means not that
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by <hi>Words,</hi> but that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by
<hi>Works;</hi> that is, he bids them follow his Example, (as St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> alſo underſtands it) <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94272:19"/> which he proves to be the meaning by what follows; where he ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teaches what he had delivered by his Example; <hi>For your ſelves know how ye ought to follow us; for we behaved not our ſelves diſorderly among you,</hi> &amp;c. v. 7, 8. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (as I may better ſay than this man doth) <hi>in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let all good men withdraw ftom them,</hi> who thus falſly pretend to <hi>Tradition;</hi> when they dare not ſtand to the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the beſt of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and <hi>walk diſorderly,</hi> by breaking their own Rule, which requires them to interpret the Scriptures according to their unanimous conſent. <hi>Counc. of</hi> Trent, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> IV.</p>
                  <p>From hence he runs back (like a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted man who catches at any thing at random) to the <hi>Firſt</hi> Epiſtle to the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. XI. 2.</note> which one would have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Front. But perhaps he was ſenſible it had nothing in it, but the bare word <hi>Tradition,</hi> to his purpoſe; and therefore brought it in after he hoped the Reader's mind would be poſſeſſed with a falſe Notion; which would make any thing go down with him. And the truth is, there is nothing here for his turn. For if the <hi>Traditions</hi> mentioned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94272:19"/> be about matters of Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, (as one would think by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, concerning Praying with the head covered or uncovered) they themſelves acknowledge ſuch Traditions do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige in all places and times. If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle means other Traditions about matters of Doctrine, how doth it appear that now they are not written? As that about the Holy Communion is, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the latter part of that Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath very fairly followed Tradition (I mean ſhamefully forſaken it), by leaving off the miniſtration of the Cup to the people, which according to what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>he received from the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them,</hi> ought to be given as much as the Bread.</p>
                  <p>Conſider then, I beſeech you, with what Conſcience or Senſe this man could ſay, That <hi>we reject all Traditions,</hi> when we receive this, for inſtance, more fully than themſelves. And how he abuſes St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in making him as ſchiſmatically unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as himſelf, by repreſenting him as diſowning us for his Brethren (which St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> durſt not do by the <hi>Donatiſts</hi>) who are ſo far from <hi>forgetting him in all things,</hi> that we remember him and his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94272:20"/> words better than they do; and keep to his Traditions (as I ſaid) juſt <hi>as he hath delivered them unto us.</hi> Poor man! he thinks he hath made a fine ſpeech for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and made him ſay to us, quite contrary to that he ſays to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Whereas, (according to <hi>Theodoret,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Interpreter than he) the Apoſtle diſpraiſes the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as much as he makes him diſpraiſe us: For theſe words, ſaith he, do not contain <hi>true Praiſe;</hi> but he ſpeaks <hi>ironically,</hi> and in truth reprehends them, <hi>as not having kept the Orders which he had ſet them.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>You have full well obſerved the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which I left with you; when there is ſuch unbecoming behaviour among you, in the time of Divine Service.</hi> Which no body need be told, unleſs he be ſuch an Ideot as this, is not a form of Commendation, but of Reproof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He comes from <hi>expreſs Scripture,</hi> to none at all; for he betakes himſelf to Reaſoning, and asks a very doughty que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; <hi>If nothing be to be believed, but only what is left us written, wherein ſhould the Church have exerciſed her ſelf from</hi> Adam
<hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>the ſpace of Two thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:94272:20"/>Let me ask him another, How doth he prove nothing was written all this time? Whence had <hi>Moſes</hi> all that he writes of the Times before him, if not out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records? It is more likely there were Writings before his, than that there were not. However, our ſaying, There were, can no more be confuted, than his ſaying, There were not, can be proved.</p>
                  <p>If the Reader be not ſatisfied with this, he bids him ſee more Scriptures, and names near a dozen places; in never a one of which there is <hi>any</hi> mention, much leſs <hi>expreſs</hi> mention of Tradition: And in the laſt, the <hi>Decrees</hi> which the Apoſtles are ſaid to deliver, are <hi>expreſly</hi> written al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in that very Chapter and place which he quotes, XV. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. For it is ſaid, v. 23. <hi>They wrote letters after this manner,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>They gathered the multitude, and delivered the</hi> EPISTLE. What an unlucky man is this, to confute himſelf after this faſhion?</p>
                  <p>As for his <hi>Fathers,</hi> he durſt not quote the words of any, but <hi>two</hi> only; St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and St.
<hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of which are out of a counterfeit part of a book of St. <hi>Baſil</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">De Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Sancto, c. 27.</note>; into which ſomebody hath foiſted a diſcourſe about <hi>Tradition,</hi> which as it belongs not at all to his ſubject, ſo it <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94272:21"/> contradicts his ſenſe in another place: Particularly in his book of <hi>Confeſſion of Faith;</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>It is a manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and arrogance, either to reject what is written, or to add any thing that is not written.</hi> But admit thoſe words which this man quotes, to be St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s, they are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, by the confeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in that ſenſe wherein he takes them: For if thoſe things which he reckons up as <hi>Apoſtolieal Traditions,</hi> have equal force with thoſe things which are written in the Scripture, how comes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to lay aſide ſeveral of them? For inſtance; the <hi>words of Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the oſtenſion of the Bread of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and the Cup of Bleſſing; the Conſecration of him that is baptized; ſtanding in Prayer on the firſt day of the week, and all the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Eaſter
<hi>and</hi> Whitſontide? And how comes it about that others of them are left at liberty, ſuch as <hi>Praying towards the</hi> Eaſt, and the
<hi>Threefold Immerſion in Baptiſm?</hi> Both which they themſelves acknowledge to be indifferent; and yet are mentioned by this falſe St.
<hi>Baſil</hi> (ſo I cannot but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem him that wrote this) among the things which are of <hi>equal force unto Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with thoſe delivered in Scripture.</hi> Nay, he proceeds ſo far as to ſay in the words
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94272:21"/> following, that if we ſhould reject ſuch unwritten Traditions, we ſhould give a deadly wound to the Goſpel; or rather contract it into a bare Name.

                  <p>As for St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> it is manifeſt he ſpeaks of the <hi>Traditions of the whole Church.</hi> And unleſs they be confirmed by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he contradicts himſelf in ſaying, <hi>Traditions not written are worthy of belief.</hi> For upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. he ſaith expreſly, <hi>If any thing unwritten be ſpoken, the</hi>

For there were others who were eminent (that is, <hi>Chiefs</hi>) upon ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or other, as well as himſelf, 2

                  <p>For ſo the Text ſaith, X. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">X.

I am ſorry for his ignorance, that he did not know, or for his diſhoneſty, that he would not conſider; this was become his name as much as <hi>Simon,</hi> before this time; for at their firſt meeting, Chriſt gave him this name of <hi>Peter,</hi> I.

<hi>ſtrengthned</hi> (for they were as ſtrong as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) but the Converted <hi>Jews,</hi> who might be in the ſame danger wherein he had been.

                  <p>From hence he leads us back to <hi>v.</hi> 26.<note place="margin">XXII.

                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:94272:42"/> in Power and Authority over the reſt; or elſe he concludes nothing: But this vanity our Saviour checks; and therefore it is far from truth, that one of them was accounted greater than another, even <hi>by Chriſt himſelf.</hi> No ſuch matter; he only ſhows them, that if in any quality one excelled another, it ſhould make him more humble and ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to his Brethren, not ſwell him, and make him perk up above them. And thus <hi>Theophylact</hi> underſtands it not of any Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in Power, but in other things. For the occaſion of their contention, Who ſhould be eſteemed greateſt; he thinks was this; That there being an enquiry among them which of them ſhould be ſo wicked as to betray their Maſter, (<hi>v.</hi> 23.) and one perhaps ſaying, Thou art likely to be the man; and another, No, it will be thy ſelf; They proceed from hence to ſay, I am bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than you, and I am greater; and ſuch like things: Which our Saviour expreſſes in the following words, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but it ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi> &amp;c Which is a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty plain denial of any Authority they were to have one over another.

The ſame is gathered from I. <hi>Act</hi> 13 merely from the order of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, which muſt be granted to one or other, in a Body where all are equal. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <hi>Chriſt's kingdom ſhall have no end</hi> (I. <hi>Luke</hi> 33.) therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> muſt reign for ever in his Succeſſors. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>not a whit behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles,</hi> (2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> XI. 5.) therefore what? common Reaſon would have concluded, therefore there were more chief Apoſtles beſides <hi>Peter;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not inferior to the greateſt of them, not to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf. Theſe are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94272:44"/> his Scripture-Arguments for their Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
                  <p>And his <hi>Fathers</hi> affirm nothing at all of
<hi>Peter,</hi> which is not ſaid of other Apoſtles. Particularly St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (who ſays no ſuch thing of <hi>Peter,</hi> as he makes him, in his 55th <hi>Hom.</hi> upon <hi>Matthew</hi>) expreſly ſays,
<hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>governed the whole World as one Ship,</hi> Hom. 25. upon
2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> and frequently calls <hi>him,</hi> as well as <hi>Peter, Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:</hi> and calls them all <hi>the Paſtors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the whole World,</hi> in his 2d <hi>Hom.</hi> upon <hi>Titus.</hi> And, to be ſhort, the Author of the imperfect Work upon St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſcribed to St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi>) calls all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops the
<hi>Vicars of Chriſt.</hi> Hom 17. Finally, there is no Title ſo great, which is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to others as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> by ancient Writers; even the Title of <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> the name of <hi>Pope, Holineſs, Bleſſed,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>

For it is the Opinion of almoſt all their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, that the
<hi>laſt Head</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>John.</hi> XVII <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and called after a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner by the Name of <hi>THE BEAST,</hi> is no other than <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Now all the forgoing <hi>Heads</hi> do not ſignify ſo many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſons only; but all Expoſitors, ſaith their <hi>Ribera</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In XVII. Revel.</note>, have underſtood that in every one of thoſe <hi>Heads,</hi> there are a great many comprehended. And never hath any man, but <hi>Victorinus</hi> taken them only for Seven ſingle Perſons, <hi>whoſe Opinion ALL do deſervedly gainſay.</hi> To the very ſame purpoſe, alſo <hi>Alcaſar,</hi> another famous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Expoſitor, writes upon the ſame place. And let this man, or any one elſe tell me, if they can, why the <hi>laſt Head,</hi> i. e. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> as he is commonly called, ſhould not comprehend a Succeſſion of ſingle Perſons of the ſame ſort, as it is is manifeſt the <hi>Beaſts</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> ſignify. The
<hi>Ram,</hi> for inſtance doth not ſignify <hi>Darius</hi> only, but the Ruling Power of <hi>Perſia,</hi> during that Kingdom. And the
<hi>He-goat,</hi> not <hi>Alexander</hi> alone, but him and his Succeſſors, VIII. <hi>Daniel</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:94272:48"/>Now from this ground, it may be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, (which is the <hi>Second</hi> thing) that the Ruling Power at this time in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> that is,
<hi>Antichriſt.</hi> For the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> are all one in this Viſion; and by <hi>Babylon</hi> is certainly meant <hi>Rome</hi> (as their great Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> the beſt of their Authors, not only confeſs but contend). And not <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> but <hi>Rome Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe ſhe is called <hi>the Great Whore,</hi> XVII. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. which always ſignifies, a People apoſtatized from true Religion to Idolatry; and becauſe it is the ſame
<hi>Babylon,</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, muſt be <hi>burnt with fire,</hi> Ver. 16. XVIII. 18. From whence <hi>Malvenda,</hi> another of their Authors, confeſſes it probable, that <hi>Rome Chriſtian</hi> will be an
<hi>Idolatrous Harlot,</hi> in the time of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> becauſe it is to be laid deſolate, it is manifeſt, for ſome Crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now that this <hi>Antichriſtian Power</hi> ruling in that
<hi>Church,</hi> is not to be adjourned to the end of the World, as they would fain have it, but is at this preſent; appears from hence, that the <hi>Sixth HEAD</hi> being that Power which reigned when St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw this Viſion (XVII. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.) there was but one <hi>Ruling Power</hi> more, and that to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <pb n="89" facs="tcp:94272:48"/> but a ſhort ſpace, to come between the end of the <hi>Sixth HEAD,</hi> and this laſt <hi>HEAD</hi> or Power, called in an eminent ſenſe, <hi>THE BEAST,</hi> v. 11. Now that
<hi>Imperial Power</hi> which reigned at <hi>Rome</hi> in time of St.
<hi>John,</hi> it is evident ended at the fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire with <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulus;</hi> when another ſetled Authority was received by the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, inſtead of that former Imperial Government. Which new Authority laſting but a ſhort ſpace, as the Viſion tells us, it is plain, <hi>THE BEAST,</hi> that is,
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is long ago in the Throne of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Let this Man, and all his Friends, try if they can anſwer this Argument, and ſee how they will free the <hi>Papacy,</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that
<hi>Antichriſtian Power,</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> foretold ſhould ariſe, and make it ſelf <hi>drunk with the Blood of the Saints.</hi> I am ſure this is a ſtronger and clearer Explication of that Scripture, than any he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</p>
                  <p>And now let us examine whether there be any thing in our Bible contrary to this. The <hi>firſt</hi> place he produces, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> II. 3,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. II. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> moſt evidently overthrows both parts of his Propoſition; as I ſhall demonſtrate. For the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> v. 3. <pb n="90" facs="tcp:94272:49"/> is no more to be reſtrained to a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than <hi>he who now letteth,</hi> v. 7. is to be reſtrained to a ſingle Emperor. Now St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in plain terms ſaith, that the Apoſtle by the <gap reason="foreign">

And this is not only his Senſe (in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the place) but the general Senſe of the Ancient Fathers (<hi>Tertullian, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> St.

                  <p>THE ſtrength of theſe Men lies only in their deceit and fraud. They dare not repreſent either their own Doctrine, or ours truly. For this Propoſition, is both true and falſe, in divers regards. It is true, that none but God can <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ſovereignly</hi> forgive Sin: But it is falſe, that no Man can forgive Sins <hi>Miniſterially</hi> and <hi>Conditionally.</hi> For by Authority from God, <pb n="97" facs="tcp:94272:52"/> Men appointed thereunto do forgive Sins, as his Miniſters, by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> by <hi>Preaching,</hi> and by
<hi>Abſolution.</hi> The only Quſtion is, Whether their Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution be only <hi>declarative,</hi> or alſo <hi>operative?</hi> And in this, if we be not all agreed, no more are they of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> For <hi>P. Lombard</hi> did not believe that the Prieſt <hi>wrought</hi> any Abſolution from Sins; but only <hi>declared</hi> the Party to be abſolved. And the moſt Ancient Schoolmen follow him; ſuch as <hi>Occam,</hi> who ſays, <hi>according to the Maſter, that Prieſts bind and looſe, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Men to be hound and looſed.</hi> In ſhort, the Doctrine of the Church is, that <hi>God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves by his Miniſters;</hi> who cannot ſee into mens hearts; and therefore can only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that he abſolves them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſal of their unfeigned Repentance. But it is apparent the Church always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, it is God who <hi>properly</hi> abſolves and forgives Sins, not the Prieſt. For all the Ancient <hi>Rituals</hi> ſhow that the Abſolution was given <hi>by Prayer to God</hi> for the Penitent, there being no other Form of Abſolution in them, but <hi>Prayers;</hi> which being made in behalf of the Penitent, they believed did obtain from God the pardon of thoſe Sins, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:94272:53"/> which he had with all humility publickly confeſſed. And therefore the preſent form, <hi>I abſolve thee,</hi> (which was never uſed but in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, and not there neither, till the middle of the XIIIth. <hi>Century</hi>) muſt be underſtood to be only a very ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, That God forgives the perſon, upon his ſincere Contrition and Repentance.</p>
                  <p>This is the meaning of our Saviour, XX. <hi>John</hi> 21.<note place="margin">XX. John 21.</note> when he made the Apoſtles his Delegates, ſaying, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you.</hi> Which ſuppoſes a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochius</hi> expounds it thus; That though the Holy Ghoſt was not given till the day of <hi>Pentceoſt,</hi> yet on the firſt day of the
<hi>Reſurrection, they received the Grace of it, by which they might remit ſins, and baptize, and make children of God, and give the Spirit of Adoption to them that believed,</hi> &amp;c. Now let any man tell me, whether it were
<hi>they</hi> that, for inſtance, <hi>gave the Spirit of Adoption,</hi> or
<hi>God</hi> himſelf; <hi>they</hi> that <hi>healed</hi> and <hi>wrought Miracles,</hi> (as they did after the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt</hi>), or God by their Miniſtry. In like <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94272:53"/> manner, it was not <hi>they</hi> who conferred Forgiveneſs of Sins, but <hi>God</hi> properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it, as he did the other Bleſſings; <hi>they</hi> only ſerving as Miniſters, by whom he conveyed it to the Penitent.</p>
                  <p>In the next place of Scripture he makes bold to add words, which are neither in our Bible, nor theirs, IX. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>When the multitude ſaw it, (i. e.</hi> the man take up his bed and walk) <hi>they marvelled and glorified God, which had given ſuch power unto men,</hi> he adds, as to forgive ſins.

<hi>Lazarus,</hi> but to the <hi>Jews</hi> who were preſent? As
<hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate,</hi> one of their own good Writers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, and ſaith, It is the opinion of all good Authors, except <hi>Auſtin, Gregory,</hi> and

Now this, which was done by any Biſhop, as well as he of <hi>Rome,</hi> we are not againſt. But ſuch Indulgences are in theſe ages of no uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the
<hi>Penitential Canons</hi> themſelves are relaxed, or rather laid aſide, and no ſuch tedious and rigorous Penances are inflicted; which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath exchanged for <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> and a ſlight <hi>Penance</hi> ſoon finiſhed</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> place he produces out of our Bible to countenance their Indulgences,<note place="margin">2 Cor.

But after all, this will not ſerve their purpoſe; for the <hi>Pardon</hi> the Apoſtle <pb n="109" facs="tcp:94272:58"/> here ſpeaks of, was nothing but the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him again to Chriſtian Communion, who had been thrown out of the Church. But is this the <hi>Indulgence</hi> they contend for in the Church of
<hi>Rome?</hi> Will this ſerve their turn? Then every Church hath as much power as this comes to; and the whole body of the Church will have a ſhare in this power of <hi>Indulgences:</hi> For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to all the
<hi>Corinthian</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in general, that they ſhould forgive him.</p>

                  <p>Which I have been the longer about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are wont to make a great noiſe with it. The next place they curtail'd heretofore in this manner;<note place="margin">Philip. II. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>He was nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, not regarding his Life, to ſupply your lack</hi> (leaving out what follows, <hi>of ſervice towards me</hi>) which made it ſound ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like, as if their <hi>lack of Goodneſs</hi> had been ſupplied by his

And all that <hi>Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> a truly Learned Expoſitor of their own, could make of them, is this,
<q rend="margQuotes">That St. <hi>Paul</hi> being in Priſon, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms <pb n="115" facs="tcp:94272:61"/> him thoſe good Offices, which the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould have done, had they not been abſent: But he ſo much neglected himſelf, while he was wholly intent upon ſerving the Apoſtle, that he fell danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſick, and lay for a time without hope of Life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finding ſo little relief in theſe places of Scripture, he betakes himſelf to arguing from that Article of our Creed, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</hi> Which <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. 1. <hi>de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg.</hi> c. 3.</note> from whom he borrows theſe goodly proofs, manages on this manner, <hi>We are taught by this Article, that all the Faithful are Members of one another, being a kind of living Body. Now as living Members help one another, ſo the Faithful communicate good things among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; eſpecially when thoſe which are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the one, are neceſſary or profitable to the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is admirable Catholick Doctrine. The <hi>Saints</hi> have more than they need, and therefore they communicate it to us, for the ſupply of our wants. But this ſhould have been proved, and not ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Saints</hi> have more than enough, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſpare; and that their Paſſions were <hi>Satisfactions,</hi> and <hi>Superabundant Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</hi> After which it would ſtill remain <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94272:62"/> a pretty undertaking to prove, that becauſe one Member helps another when it ſuffers any thing; therefore the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of one Member will
<hi>Cure</hi> another Member; the Pain, for inſtance, of the long Finger will free the little Finger from the pain which it it ſuffers. Thus the Actions and Paſſions of <hi>Saints</hi> are not imparted to us; as this Man preſumes from the Relation we have one to another; and yet they ſerve for very good purpoſes to the Church, as I have already ſhown.</p>
                  <p>And one would imagine he diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Argument after he had ſet it down, becauſe he runs back again to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Pſalm 63. <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</hi> Thus the words run expreſly in our Bible. Now let me beſeech the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to conſider what <hi>Action or Prayer of the Church Triumphant, for the Church Militant or Patient, or for both,</hi> he can find contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Text, as he ſaith there is in <hi>all the Paſſages</hi> he quotes. Let him look into the next, and I will be his Bonds man, if <pb n="117" facs="tcp:94272:62"/> he meet with a word of any <hi>Action or Prayer of the Church Triumphant;</hi> but only mention of

<hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 28. As for LIII. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Church always thought it a Prophecy of the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not of the
<hi>Saints;</hi> and ſo the Apoſtles interpret it in many places. If he mean, LIII. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9. (as one Edition of his Book hath it) there are not ſo many Verſes in it; and we ſhould be as far to ſeek for any ſenſe, if we ſhould <hi>ſee more,</hi> and therefore I will look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>What the Fathers affirm, he bids us alſo <hi>ſee,</hi> but doth not tell us; and I cannot truſt him ſo much, as to think it worth my pains to look into the places, to which he points us. St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I am ſure (the <hi>firſt</hi> he names) is abuſed by him; who hath not a word of this matter in his <hi>Second</hi> Chapter of his Book, about <hi>the Care of the Dead;</hi> which is altogether concerning this Queſtion,
<hi>Whether the Dead ſuffer any thing for want of Burial?</hi> Upon the LXI.
<hi>Pſalm</hi> indeed (which he quotes at laſt) he mentions that place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 24. <pb n="118" facs="tcp:94272:63"/> and diſcourſes how Chriſt ſuffered not only in his own Perſon, but in his Members; every one of which ſuffers what comes to his ſhare; and all of them together fill up what is wanting of the Sufferings of Chriſt. So that none hath <hi>Superabundant</hi> Sufferings; but he expreſly ſaith, That we every one of us, <hi>Pro modulo noſtro,</hi> according to our ſmall meaſure, <hi>Pay what we owe,</hi> (mark that, <hi>not more</hi> than we are obliged unto, which is the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine, but what we are bound unto) <hi>and to the utmoſt of our Power we caſt in, as it were, the ſtint or meaſure of Sufferings, which will not be filled up</hi> till the end <hi>of the World.</hi> Which is directly againſt what this Man, and his Church, would have: For they that bring in but their ſhare, and nothing more than they owe, have no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant Paſſions,</hi> out of which flow
<hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Satisfaction.</hi>

<hi>Firſt,</hi> That a Man have done all that God's Law commands.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That he have done ſomething which it commandeth not. But who is there that hath done all which God's Law requires? That is, who is without all Sin?

We do not ſay, all things are commanded, but ſome are counſelled; yet there are men of great Name in the Church (ſuch as St.
<hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and St. <hi>Hilary</hi>) who call this a Commandment which Chriſt gave the young man.

                  <p>WHat ſhall one do with a man that oppoſeth he knows not what? The <hi>firſt part</hi> of this Propoſition is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, who in effect ſaith the ſame, III. <hi>Rom.</hi> 28. II. <hi>Gal.</hi> 16. Therefore no man ſhould be ſo bold as to contradict it, but rather explain it; which it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to do; for when we ſay, <hi>Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifies,</hi> this <hi>Faith</hi> includes in it a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere purpoſe of good living; without which, we believe it will not juſtifie. And therefore the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of it is a new ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That we affirm <hi>Good works are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation;</hi> the direct contrary to which, we heartily believe: For <hi>it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to our Salvation,</hi> we all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>that we act according to our Faith;</hi> tho by ſuch Good works, we can merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither

<hi>the merit</hi> of them. And thus <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> himſelf ſhows (upon V. <hi>Gal.</hi>) That <hi>Faith alone will not ſuffice, tho Faith alone ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies.</hi>
                  </p>

<hi>Cor.</hi> XIII. 2. which ſpeaks of a <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Faith;</hi> and beſides, doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict us, who believe Faith without works will not avail to Salvation; though let us do never ſo much, we can never merit it by what we do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Text, II. <hi>Jam.</hi> 24.<note place="margin">James II. 24.</note> is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what we ſay, That <hi>the Faith which juſtifies, includes in it a purpoſe of well-doing.</hi> Such an one as was in <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe Faith, in purpoſing to offer up
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs, tho he had not actually done as he purpoſed to do. In like manner, if any man ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Chriſtian Faith, and be baptized, he is juſtified, tho he have not as yet brought forth the fruit of it in good works; (witneſs the
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> VIII. <hi>Acts</hi> 37.) which <pb n="130" facs="tcp:94272:69"/> if he ſhould not produce afterward, he could not be ſaved. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in that very Book and Chapter which he quotes, expreſly ſaith, <hi>Good Works follow him that is juſtified, they do not precede him that is to be juſtified.</hi> What doth he think of the Thief upon the Croſs, who only believed, and was not ſo much as baptized?</p>
                  <p n="2">II <hi>James</hi> 14. is not contrary to what we ſay, but according to it. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon theſe very words, ſaith, <hi>Therefore we are ſaved by Faith, becauſe it joins us to God; which is done no other way, but that living by his Spirit, we be governed by him.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> agree very well; though the one ſay: <hi>We are not juſtified by Faith only,</hi> (which is St.
<hi>James</hi>'s Doctrine); and the other, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in effect ſays, We are juſtified by Faith only, when he ſaith, <hi>We are juſtified by Faith, without Works.</hi> As he ſhows in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe; where he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Juſtification <hi>by Faith,</hi> and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>by Works;</hi> and affirms <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by Works, but by Faith. St. <hi>James</hi> alledging the ſame caſe, and the very ſame words, proves he was juſtified by Works, and <hi>not by Faith only.</hi> Can any one think they make uſe of the ſame inſtance, for quite contrary ends? It is a wonder men <pb n="131" facs="tcp:94272:69"/> do not learn this plain and eaſie truth from hence; That Faith alone (having in it a purpoſe of well-doing) enters us into the ſtate of Juſtification, before we have done what we purpoſe; but Good Works are neceſſary to continue us in this ſtate, and ſo may be ſaid to juſtifie us; that is, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue our Juſtification, which <hi>Faith only</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</p>

                  <p>No Church in the World more beats down <hi>vain ſecurity,</hi> than this of ours; nor doth any more incourage it, than the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> where men are ſecured of their Salvation, if they can be ſo vain as to believe it, by confeſſing to a Prieſt, and receiving his Abſolution at the laſt Gaſp.</p>
                  <p>The other Scriptures which he hath ſhovelled together, are of no different im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from theſe, and therefore need not be examined.

                  <p>It is true, in the XII. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.<note place="margin">XII. Acts 13.</note> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, who were aſſembled in <hi>Mary</hi>'s Houſe, were of opinion, That it was the

                  <p>Why he adds the two next places, unleſs to make a ſhow, I cannot imagine. For <hi>H ſter</hi>'s Apocryphal Prayer hath nothing in it ſounding this way, but only thoſe words, <hi>O God of</hi> Abraham. And
<hi>David</hi> only ſays, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIX. 8. <hi>O God of Abraham Iſaac, and Iſrael, our Fathers.</hi> Which no Man in the World but himſelf, I believe, will take to be <hi>naming them for his Interceſſors,</hi> (as he ſpeaks) when they evidently ſignify the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and kindneſs God had to them, which he hoped he would graciouſly continue, according to his Promiſe, unto his People <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt place, XX. <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. is a direct Confutation of all that he ſaith; for it mentions not the <hi>Merits</hi> of good Men, but the <hi>Mercy</hi> which God will ſhow unto

Concerning which, I think both <hi>Maldonate</hi> and <hi>Menochius</hi> (two conſiderable Jeſuits) have very judiciouſly reſolved, for the quieting of this doubt, whether it be <hi>Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Parable;</hi> that <hi>it is both.</hi>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">For that there was a rich man, and a poor, called <hi>Lazarus;</hi> that the one when he died went to Hell, and the other was carried to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, <hi>is a Hiſtory.</hi> But that the rich man talk'd with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and deſired him to ſend
<hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to cool his Tongue with a drop of Water, <hi>is a Parable</hi> adjoyned to the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for they that are in Hell, do not ask Courteſies of the Saints.</q> Now it happens unfortunately for this man, that what he grounds his Argument upon, falls within that part which is <hi>Parable, Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>have mercy on me.</hi> Which <hi>Maldonate</hi> judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerves, is a form of Speech, which Beggers uſe; as they lye in the High-way, ſhowing their ſores; and well repreſents how
<hi>Lazarus</hi> and he had changed Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was poor here, and the rich <pb n="186" facs="tcp:94272:97"/> man ſtript of all there. Here the rich man enjoyed his pleaſure, and there <hi>Lazarus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced. No man of ſenſe can reject this Interpretation. And yet this Writer cries out,
<hi>Lo, two Saints are here prayed to, and beſought in one verſe.</hi> Nay, he hath the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ask us, <hi>For God-ſake, where are your Eyes?</hi> Truly, mine are newly open this morning, when men are wont to be moſt ſober; and I can ſee none to whom the rich man addreſſes his Requeſt, but <hi>Abraham,</hi> alone.

<hi>Lazarus</hi> in this Parable, but all to <hi>Abraham;</hi> who is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſend <hi>Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger,</hi> &amp;c. And yet this man was ſo intoxicated with ſome thing or other, that he thinks the rich man called upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> alſo, to have Mercy on him. For ſhame, let them throw this Book away, and not give it about any more. For all that can be gathered from this ſtory is, that ſuch was the torment of the rich man, that if he could have ſeen <hi>Abraham,</hi> and

                  <p>NOW he falls again to his old trade of downright calumniating our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For we teach, That there is no Salvation for Infants, in the ordinary way of the Church, without Baptiſm. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that by an expreſs Canon (LXIX.) every Miniſter is to be ſuſpended for <hi>three months,</hi> who ſuffers any Infant in his Pariſh to dye without Baptiſm, being informed of its weakneſs, and danger of death, and deſired to come and baptize the ſame: And is not to be reſtored, till he acknowledg his fault, and promiſe before his Ordinary, that he will not wittingly incur the like again. But we do not tye God to thoſe means, to the uſe of which he hath tyed us; and therefore do believe, that by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Grace and Mercy, thoſe Infants may be ſaved, who, without their own fault, dye unbaptized. And this was the Faith of the <pb n="200" facs="tcp:94272:104"/> Ancient Church, as appears from <hi>Socrates</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">L. <hi>V.</hi> Hiſt. c.

But ſtill this is an evidence, they did not think it abſolutely neceſſary; nor do the greateſt Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſuch as <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> Card. <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and many others I could name, condemn children to Hell, who dye unbaptized; but being the children of Faithful Parents, look upon them as within the Covenant of Grace, and capable of eternal life: For which they give theſe reaſons: <hi>Frſt,</hi> The infinite Mercy of God, who is not tied to the <hi>Sacraments</hi> which he hath ordained: And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> The like caſe under the Old Teſtament, when <hi>Circumciſion</hi> anſwered to our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (as this man acknowledges) and the children dying unbaptized, were notwithſtanding ſaved
<hi>by the ſole Faith of their Parents.</hi> So S. <hi>Bernard, Epiſt.</hi>
77. <hi>ad Hug. de S. Vict.</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi> in 3. <hi>part. Thom. Q.</hi> 68.

                  <p>Matters therefore being thus ſtated, all his <hi>Texts</hi> are already anſwered. We ſay the very ſame our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth, III. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">III.

But tho this be the
<hi>ordinary</hi> way, we dare not ſay it is the <hi>only.</hi> God's Grace, many of themſelves acknowledge, ſupplies the want of Baptiſm, in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes. Thus even <hi>Lorinus</hi> a Jeſuit, in X.
<hi>Act.</hi> 44. and he alledges St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for it (who was very rigid in this point) that the <hi>inviſible Sanctification</hi> ſometimes is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, without the <hi>viſible Sacrament;</hi> when not by contempt of Religion, but by mere neceſſity, they are deprived of Baptiſm.

                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Tit.</hi> 5. proves no more, but that Baptiſm is the ordinary way, and ought not to be neglected, where it can be had.</p>
                  <p>From XVI. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. he concludes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94272:105"/> That children muſt be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or not Saved,<note place="margin">XVI.

                        <hi>Seſſ.</hi> VII. Can. 14.</note>: <hi>Children wanting Faith in the firſt act, are baptized in the Faith of the Church.</hi> And therefore the true way of arguing from this place is, that as our Lord ſaith,

<hi>he that believeth not, and is not baptized, ſhall be damned.</hi> But he only ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned;</hi> which makes Faith only, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> neceſſary. And I ſhowed before, there are thoſe in his own Church, who think the <hi>Faith of the Parents</hi> ſufficient for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And thus the moſt learned of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> expound thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <p>His laſt Text, XVII. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">XVII. Gen. 14.</note> proves no more but the neceſſity of both
<hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> where they could be had; as was ſhewn before.

                  <p>His <hi>Fathers,</hi> which he hath pickt up out of
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> are not worth examining; becauſe ſome of them ſpeak only againſt thoſe who deny Infants to be regenerate in Baptiſm, as St.
<hi>Auſtin, Epiſt.</hi> 90. Others ſpeak of it in ſuch terms as are not eaſie to be underſtood; for let him inform us what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> means in the place he quotes, That <hi>our bodies have received unity by the waſhing of incorruption, and our ſouls by the ſpirit:</hi> And others ſpeak ſuch words of the neceſſity of Baptiſm, as the Papiſts themſelves will not abide by; but confeſs St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was too hard in his opinion, which muſt admit of ſome exception: And his opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by later Fathers, as they call them; particularly St.
<hi>Bernard,</hi> who diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <pb n="204" facs="tcp:94272:106"/> it at large in the Epiſtle before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. As for St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epiſtle to
<hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> it is wholly againſt the opinion which that Biſhop had received, That children of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> days old were not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; but they were to ſtay till the <hi>eighth</hi> day, as in Circumciſion. But there is not a word of the <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity of Baptiſm; but that none ſhould be denied it, tho new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born; who the rather ſhould be received, becauſe, not their own ſins but anothers was there remitted to them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now where doth the Scripture ſay it is a <hi>Sacrament?</hi> There is not a word of it in VIII. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.<note place="margin">VIII.

                  <p>He betrays alſo notorious ignorance, or falſhood, in the Citations of his <hi>Fathers,</hi> to which he ſends us. For

So doth St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> likewiſe, even in that place which he mentions; where is no ſuch ſenſe as he dreams. For he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes for the Re-baptizing of Hereticks,
<hi>becauſe it is not enough if hands be laid upon them, unleſs they receive the Baptiſm of the Church; for then they are fully ſanctified, and made the Children of God, if they be born by both Sacraments; for it is written, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a Man be born again of Water, and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> &amp;c.

<hi>Two</hi> Rites, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:94272:108"/> 
                     <hi>Waſhing with Water,</hi> and
<hi>Laying on of Hands.</hi> Which were not <hi>Two Sacraments</hi> properly, but <hi>Two parts</hi> of the ſame Sacrament; which he calls <hi>both the Sacraments of Baptiſm.</hi> Juſt as <hi>Hulbertus Carnotenſis,</hi> calls the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Communion, <hi>Two Sacraments,</hi> which in truth are but one. For ſpeaking of three things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, he ſaith of the <hi>Third,</hi> that in it <hi>Two Sacraments of Life, that is, the Lords Body, and his Blood, are contained.</hi> St.
<hi>Hierom</hi> likewiſe ſpeaks of <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> but not as a diſtinct Sacrament: For he earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly contends (in that Book) that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is conferred in Baptiſm, and that there can be no Baptiſm of the Church, without the Spirit.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94272:110"/> adminiſtred, as different from the Cup he had before mentioned.

<hi>Menochius</hi> (to name no others) might have taught him better, who thus expounds this paſſage. <hi>Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaks after the manner of men, who being to depart from their Friends for a long time, are wont to ſay, We ſhall Eat and Drink together no more.

<hi>New Teſtament in his Blood,</hi> the fruit <pb n="212" facs="tcp:94272:111"/> of the Vine, that is <hi>Wine.</hi> And ſo not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we, but <hi>Origen, Cyprian, Chryſoſtom, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Hierom, Epiphanius, Bede, Euthymius,</hi> and
<hi>Theophylact,</hi> refer the <hi>fruit of the Vine</hi> unto the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> before mentioned; as <hi>Maldonate</hi> himſelf acknowledges, and could not produce ſo much as one <hi>Father</hi> to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>He might have known alſo, that a great many of his own Church,<note place="margin">VI.

<hi>eating</hi> he here ſpeaks of, as appears by the whole ſcope of the Chapter. For if any ſuch Converſion, as they fancy in the Sacrament, and call <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> could be proved out of this Text, it would prove the Fleſh of Chriſt is turned into Bread, rather than the Bread into his Fleſh; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith. <hi>The Bread that I will give you, is my Fleſh.</hi> To make this good literally, it is manifeſt, <hi>his Fleſh muſt be made Bread.</hi> See into what Abſurdities theſe men draw themſelves, by their perverſe Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <pb n="213" facs="tcp:94272:111"/> It is not worth conſidering what he ſaith about <hi>Beza</hi>'s interpretation of one word in this Verſe; there being thoſe of his own Church, as well as he, that by <hi>living Bread,</hi> underſtand <hi>Bread that gives Life;</hi> which is muſt ſuitable to the words preceding, and unto <hi>v.</hi> 33.</p>

And therefore do not ſay, as he ſlanders us, That Chriſt gave, and the Apoſtles received, <hi>nothing elſe but bare Bread;</hi> for it was the <hi>Sacrament of Chriſt's Body;</hi> as <hi>Druthmarus,</hi> and a great many more Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than he, expound thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> We believe alſo, and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, that the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, <hi>is the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> But thoſe are St.

<hi>the Bread is his Body,</hi> which we believe, and they are ſo abſurd as to deny. Tho we have bidden them note, <pb n="214" facs="tcp:94272:112"/> how St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> in that very place he next mentions (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI.) often calls that, which he ſaith is the <hi>Lord's Body,</hi> by the name of
<hi>Bread, v.</hi> 26, 27, 28. But they ſhut their Eyes, and will not take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.

                     <hi>Melchiſedeck ſacrificed Bread and Wine:</hi> unleſs we will make his offering them to <hi>Abraham</hi> (unto whom he <hi>brought them forth,</hi> as ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Fathers</hi> conſent) to be a proper Sacrifice.

<hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> between the Bread and Wine in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> and that which <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> brought forth: but this is againſt the

                  <p>His Argument from XXII. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. is very idle. For when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is my Body which is given for you;</hi> the meaning is, which I have offered to be a Sacrifice to God (X. <hi>John</hi>
17.) and am about actually to give in Sacrifice for you. And ſo their own

                  <p>IT is ſome ſatisfaction that we ſhall part fairly; for in Concluſion he ſpeaks truly and plainly. This is our Doctrine, which is ſo agreeable to the expreſs words of the Bible; that unleſs the Bible contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it ſelf, nothing can be found there to the contrary.</p>

                     <note place="margin">I Luke 8.</note>St. <hi>Luke</hi> I. 8. ſaith nothing of any words the Prieſt ſpake, when he miniſtred <hi>in the Sanctuary.</hi> Nor do we find in the Bible, the leaſt mention of Publick Prayers he made there, but only of <hi>burning Incenſe;</hi> which the People well underſtood repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the going up of their Prayers to God with acceptance; which they made <hi>without,</hi> while he burnt Incenſe
<hi>within.</hi> Which may be called a <hi>Symbolical Prayer;</hi> the meaning of which was as well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the People, as what they themſelves
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94272:140"/> ſpake. The Angel indeed tells him, <hi>v.</hi> 13.
<hi>thy Prayer is heard;</hi> but this doth not prove he ſpake any words, but rather lifted up his mind to God, when the Incenſe aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards Heaven. For it is manifeſt he continued his Miniſtration after he was ſtruck Dumb; and therefore it was not the Cuſtom to ſpeak any words. But ſuppoſe he did, how doth it appear he did not ſpeak in the Language he uſed at other times, the Language of the Country? Tho it is not material whether he did or no; for the People were not in a Capacity to hear his Voice. And therefore this place, if it prove any thing, proves too much; that the Publick Service of the Church may be ſaid in a place ſeparate from all the People, where they can neither hear, nor ſee the Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>The XVI. <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.<note place="margin">XVI. Lev.
17.</note> is moſt abſurdly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to ſerve this purpoſe, becauſe it ſpeaks of a <hi>Typical Service</hi> in the moſt Holy Place; unto which we have nothing here anſwerable upon Earth, but is fulfilling in the Interceſſion which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt makes for us continually in Heaven, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his moſt precious Blood, wherewith he entred in thither. Beſides, the High-Prieſt of old, ſaid not one word while he
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94272:141"/> ſtaid there; and therefore this can be no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the People need not underſtand the Publick Prayers of the Church, which are made, not in ſuch a Secret Place as that was, but openly in the hearing of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Who, by this reaſoning, may be ſhut out of the Church, as well as excluded from underſtanding the Prayers, and the Prieſt left there to a ſilent Service by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Fathers</hi> being wanting (for they are all againſt a Service in an unknown Tongue) he pretends he hath no need of them; tho he needleſly heapt them up, where he could find a word, that ſeemed to look that way he would have it. But he ſupplies this want with a bold untruth, That the <hi>practice of the whole Chriſtian World, for theſe many hundred years hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us,</hi> who would have Divine Service in a Language the People underſtand: Which can be ſalved by nothing, but by another proud falſity, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the whole Chriſtian World. For no Church uſes <hi>Latin Service,</hi> but ſuch as are under the Dominion of the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> all others uſe the Language of their ſeveral Countries. Nay, there are ſome who have acknowledged his Authority, <pb n="269" facs="tcp:94272:141"/> that would ſtill have the Publick Service in their own Language, which the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>For ſhame, let theſe men leave off Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and betake themſelves to their Prayers, that God would forgive them their abominable Falſhoods, wherewith they have laboured to maintain their Cauſe; particularly in this point, about Publick Service in a Language the People do not underſtand. Which they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is againſt the expreſs Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. and therefore this man thinks himſelf concern'd to attempt an Anſwer unto what we alledge from hence.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>firſt</hi> he diſtinguiſhes between
<hi>Publick</hi> Prayer and <hi>Private,</hi> which here is very idle, for it is evident, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers <hi>in the Church,</hi> verſe 19. <hi>When the whole Church came together in one place,</hi> verſe
23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith this place is againſt us, becauſe it proves the <hi>Common Service of the Church, was not then in a Tongue which every man underſtood, but in another Language, not ſo common to all,</hi> verſe 16. Mark, how he contradicts himſelf; before he ſuppoſed (or elſe he talk'd impertinently) that the <pb n="270" facs="tcp:94272:142"/> Apoſtle diſcourſes of <hi>Private Prayers;</hi> now he acknowledges it is <hi>the Common Service of the Church,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, but ſhews it was not in the <hi>Common Language.</hi> What a brow have theſe men, who can thus out-face the cleareſt truth? That which the Apoſtle condemns as a fault of ſome Perſons, and condemns as utterly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the very end of Speech, as well as with the Edification of the Church; this man makes to have been common al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Practice. Was there ever ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication? A man had better have no uſe of Reaſon, than Diſcourſe on this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no Tongue at all, than talk at this rate, expreſly againſt the Apoſtle's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, who requires him, who could not deliver what he ſpake in a known Tongue, or had no Interpreter, <hi>To hold his peace, and ſpeak to himſelf, and to God,</hi> v. 28.</p>
                  <p>His Argument to juſtify their Practice is ſo ſilly, that it cannot but make a good man ſigh deeply, to think that poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant People ſhould be miſ led by ſuch Ideots. For he takes him, <hi>who occupied the place of the unlearned</hi> (in verſe 16.) to be one, who was required, or ſuppoſed to be there, to ſupply the unlearned man's
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94272:142"/> place, <hi>That is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>one who ſhould have further underſtanding of that Tongue in which the Service of the Church is ſaid.</hi> Which he imagines is a proof, the Service was not in the Vulgar Tongue, for then there had been no need of one to ſupply the Ideots place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is ſuch a groſs piece of
<hi>Duncery,</hi> as his Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have corrected, if he had look'd into him, or any of the Ancient and Modern Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters: Who by one that <hi>takes up the place of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned,</hi> do not underſtand, one that <hi>acts in the ſtead of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned Perſon,</hi> (that's a dull fancy, never heard of among the Learned) but <hi>one that ſits in the Place</hi> or <hi>Bench,</hi> is <hi>in the Form,</hi> as we ſpeak, <hi>of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned.</hi> That is, an <hi>Ignorant Perſon,</hi> who is the man that the Apoſtle ſaith, could not ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not what was ſaid in the Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. So <hi>Menochius</hi> upon that Text, <hi>He</hi> that ſits among the Simple and Rude, who are <hi>ignorant of Tongues,</hi> how ſhall he ſay, <hi>Amen?</hi> That is, <hi>approve thy Prayer, if he do not underſtand it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Cavil therefore at the <hi>Geneva</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is fooliſh, if not malicious; for they tranſlate the words honeſtly, not deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, according to the certain ſenſe of <pb n="272" facs="tcp:94272:143"/> them; there being no difference between an <hi>Ideot,</hi> and he <hi>who ſupplies the place of an Ideot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We know of no Reformed Churches, where they do not ſay
<hi>Amen</hi> to their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers. Here we are ſure the People are enjoyned ſo to do. Therefore it is another Slander, if he object this to us, who have not turned <hi>Amen</hi> into <hi>So be it,</hi> as he ſays many of the Reformed Churches have done. If it be true, that any have expounded the word, into others of like ſignification, it was for the Edification of the People, and no body hath juſt reaſon to find fault with them, if the People did not underſtand its meaning. Which they did in <hi>Greece,</hi> as much as in <hi>Judea,</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle had reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
                  <p>But he belies St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as he hath done us, when he makes him ſay, <hi>It is not lawful to turn</hi> Amen <hi>into any other language, without the ſcandal of the whole Church.</hi> For he ſaith,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                        <note n="*" place="margin">L.
<hi>2.</hi> de Doct. Chriſt. c. <hi>10.</hi>
                        </note>There is ſuch variety of
<hi>Latin</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Scripture, as makes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> neceſſary; that when one doubts of the
<hi>Latin,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may be had thither; (this is worth marking for other purpoſes). Tho ſome <pb n="273" facs="tcp:94272:143"/> 
                        <hi>Hebrew</hi> words indeed we often find are not interpreted, as <hi>Amen, Allelujah, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> and <hi>Oſanna,</hi> &amp;c. Which Antiquity hath preſerved, partly,
<hi>for the more ſacred Authority, tho they might have been interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (obſerve that) as <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah;</hi> partly, becauſe it's ſaid they cannot be tranſlated into another tongue, as the two other words, <hi>Racha,</hi> and <hi>Oſanna.</hi>
                     </q> In which diſcourſe he ſays nothing of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of Tranſlating the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, nor of the ſcandal their Tranſlation would give; but only of ſome of them, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>Amen,</hi> being more venerable in the Original Language, than in any other. What he ſays in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> I cannot ſtand to examine; for in that <hi>Epiſtle</hi> which he quotes, there is nothing to be found about this matter.</p>
                  <p>In concluſion, he is driven to this ſhift, to ſay, That our own Service is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, becauſe it conſiſts partly of the
<hi>Pſalms of David</hi> (which he moſt falſly ſays are <hi>the hardeſt part of all the Bible</hi>) and of <hi>Leſſons</hi> out of the
<hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> which are not underſtood by the people. But is this all that our Service conſiſts of? Have we not <hi>Prayers</hi> and
<hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> eaſie to be underſtood every word? As in the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94272:144"/> other part of the Service they underſtand enough for their Edification; whereas of their <hi>Maſs,</hi> the ſimple people underſtand nothing: Or ſuppoſe they underſtand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet this will not make their caſe like ours; becauſe the people with us have all in their vulgar Language, tho they do not every one underſtand all; but they have not a word in their vulgar language, tho ſome perhaps may underſtand a little of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue.</p>
                  <p>And what is the reaſon they dare not truſt the
<hi>Maſs</hi> in the vulgar language? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hard to be underſtood? No, but quite contrary, becauſe the people would eaſily find things there which confute their own Religion, and are conformable unto ours. For who would believe <hi>Purgatory</hi> any longer, who heard the Prieſt ſay in the vulgar tongue, <hi>Lord, remember thy ſervants and handmaids that are gone before us, with the ſign of Faith, and ſleep in the ſleep of peace?</hi> If they be <hi>in peace,</hi> every one would be ready to ſay, Then they are not <hi>burning in the Purgatory fire;</hi> and what need I give my money to Pray them out from thence? The like paſſages there are, that would make them believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be a Fable; and that it is a novel thing to have <pb n="275" facs="tcp:94272:144"/> the Divine Service in an
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue;</hi> which I have not room to mention: But deſire the Reader to obſerve how this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is condemned out of the mouths of many great perſons in their own Church. I will name <hi>Two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One is Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. who ſaith, Out of this Doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> we learn, <hi>That it is better for the Edification of the Church, that the Publick Prayers which are ſaid in the audience of the people, ſhould be ſaid in the tongue common to Clerks and People, than ſaid in</hi> Latin. A moſt ingenuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; in which he doth but follow one of their <hi>Saints,</hi> viz.
<hi>Anſelm,</hi> in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſame Chapter; <hi>That is good which thou ſayeſt, but another is not edified by thy words, which he underſtands not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince you meet in the Church for Edification, thoſe things ought to be ſaid in the Church, which may be underſtood by men, and afford Edification to the hearers.</hi>
